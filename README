In its current state maven should download all necessary dependencies and the tests should execute.

One will pass and one will fail (this is by design).

Default reports are generated in the folder /target/jbehave/view and I’ve also included my ConsoleStoryReporter class
for better test output and as an example of how to add a custom StoryReporter class.

It should be suitable as a skeleton to start your own JBehave project if desired.

Once the project is all set up, run the class “ExampleJBehaveStory” as a Junit test.
